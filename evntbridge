2. Test Manually Using the CLI
Since the console doesn't allow testing, you can simulate and test the rule using the AWS CLI.

Step 1: Get the Rule's ARN
Run the following command to list all rules and identify your specific rule:

bash
Copy code
aws events list-rules
Step 2: Test with a Sample Event
Create a test event that mimics an S3 event. Save this JSON to a file named test-event.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "source": "aws.s3",
  "detail-type": "Object Created",
  "detail": {
    "bucket": {
      "name": "your-bucket-name"
    },
    "object": {
      "key": "your-file-name"
    }
  }
}
Invoke the rule with the CLI:

bash
Copy code
aws events test-event-pattern --event '{"source": "aws.s3", "detail-type": "Object Created", "detail": {"bucket": {"name": "your-bucket-name"}, "object": {"key": "your-file-name"}}}' --rule "your-rule-name"
If it matches the rule, the output will confirm the event matches.
